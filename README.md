#### By _**Everett Lee-Wuollet**_

## Description

_This application will allow employees track the availability status of wetsuits for rent. This is the employee interface side of the application._

_The primary goals will be an easy access application that sorts wetsuits by availability (in, out, available or reserved).  It should also have and 'effective size' category for suits which are technically classified as one size, but because of the brand are far close to another._

_Stretch Goals include authentication, size listing and sorting by availability._
